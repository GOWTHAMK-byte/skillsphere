SkillSphere: Intelligent Team Finder for Hackathons & Projects

SkillSphere is a dynamic web application designed to intelligently connect individuals for hackathons, academic projects, and competitions. It moves beyond simple listings by using a recommendation engine to match users based on their skills, location, and even complementary abilities, ensuring the formation of well-rounded and effective teams.

        Add a wide range of technical and design skills to your profile.

        Verify skills by completing projects, taking skill-specific quizzes, or uploading certificates.

        Level up your skills through successful project completions and quiz performance.

    üèÜ Gamified Leaderboard: A competitive leaderboard ranks users based on their total skill levels and verifications across different categories (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.).
